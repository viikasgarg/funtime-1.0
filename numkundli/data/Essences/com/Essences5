With the Essence of the number 5 you will find that the events and opportunities coming your way will emphasize freedom and change. Your experiences during this cycle will be sudden, unusual, and unexpected, and you are apt to be dealing with constantly changing circumstances and activities. The ventures in your life now will stress progress, new ideas, and probably new friends. Travel is very likely. There should be a caution here to avoid tendencies to go off in every direction and scatter your forces. Choose your opportunities carefully and thoughtfully. Freedom is great, but be sure to use it in constructive ways that help others and yourself.
