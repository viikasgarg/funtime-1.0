Character
High spiritual plane, intuitive, illumination, idealist, a dreamer.

Positive
You are spiritually aware and illuminated. You yield understanding and knowledge beyond the grasp of others. Your attitude toward life is somewhat extreme. You're extremely intuitive, avant-garde, idealistic, visionary, and cultured. These extremes make you an interesting, if not unusual person, with much to offer society.

You are a deep-thinker and no doubt interested in understanding many of life's mysteries and more intriguing facets. Your inventive mind and broad-minded views will permit you to succeed in life in any number of ventures. You can best serve society, however, in those endeavors utilizing your skills of counselling and guidance. Much of your idealism is people oriented and quite humanitarian in nature. You expect a great deal of yourself and of those to whom you are close.
Your ideas seem to have been inspired on high. Perhaps you are not a leader, but you are a visionary and a very talented idea person.

Negative
On the negative side, you harbor a lot of nervous tension associated with your life path. You can be a difficult person to deal with because of this. For this reason, relationships, at times, can be difficult. You may experience broad mood swings between elation and depression. You are likely to have trouble making decisions and getting your life in gear. There is a tendency for you to harbor feelings of uneasiness, and dissatisfaction with accomplishments and personal progress in life.

Your grandiose schemes usually make sense, but you can get off track and they can be very impractical. You have a very distinct side that lacks common sense, and you are quite often unable to distinguish between fantasy and reality. In this regard, you are perhaps more of a dreamer than a doer. When you do get on target, your ideas seem to have been inspired on high. Perhaps you are not a leader, but you are a visionary and a very talented idea person.
