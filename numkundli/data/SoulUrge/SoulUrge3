Positive
Your desire in life is personal expression, and you generally enjoy life to   its fullest. You want to participate in an active social life and enjoy a large circle of friends. You want to be in the limelight, expressing your artistic or intellectual talents. Word skills may be your thing; speaking, writing, acting, or singing. In a positive sense, you're friendly, outgoing and  always very social.

You have a decidedly upbeat attitude that is rarely discouraged. You also have a good mental and emotional balance.

You have intuitive insight, thus, very high creative and inspirational tendencies. Your truly outstanding trait is that of self-expression, regardless of the field of endeavor.

Negative
On the negative side, you may become too easygoing and too optimistic, tending to scatter forces and accomplish very little. Often, you're a non- stop talker. Everyone has faults, but you don't appreciate having these pointed out.
