Positive
You would like to be appreciated for your ability to handle responsibility. Your home and family are likely to be a strong focus for you, perhaps the strongest focus of your life. Friendship, love, and affection are high on your list of priorities for a happy life. You have a lot of diplomatic tendencies in your makeup, as you are able to rectify and balance situations with an innate skill. You like working with people rather than by yourself. It is extremely important for you to have harmony in your environment at all times.

Your positive side produces a huge capacity for responsibility; you are always there and ready to assume more than your share of the load. You are known for your generosity, understanding and deep sympathetic attitude. You are very giving of love, affection, and emotional support. You may have the inclination to teach or serve your community in other idealistic ways. You have natural abilities to help people. You are also  likely to have artistic and creative leanings.

Negative
With such a strong sympathetic attitude, it is easy to become too emotional. Sometimes the desires to render help can be over done, and it can become interfering and an attitude that is too protective, rather than helpful. You often find that people tend to take advantage of your very giving spirit. You may tend to repress your own needs so that you can cater to the demands from others. At times, there may be a tendency for becoming over-loaded with such demands, and as a result become resentful.
