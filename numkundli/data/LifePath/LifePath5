Character
Expansiveness, visionary, adventure, the constructive use of freedom.

Positive
You are very versatile, adventurous, and progressive. You are always striving to find answers to the many questions that life poses. You want to be totally unrestrained, as this is the sign of freedom and independence. You dislike routine and boring work. You are not very good at sticking with everyday tasks that must be finished on time. You are a good communicator, and you know how to motivate people around you. You would make a good teacher.

A love of adventure may dominate your life. This may take the form of mental or physical manifestation, but in either case, you thrill to the chance for exploration and blazing new trails. You are apt to be multi-talented, but just as likely to suffer from some lack of direction, and there is often some confusion surrounding your ambition.

You are a happy-go-lucky kind of person, living for today, and not worrying too much about tomorrow. It is important for you to mix with people of a like mind, and try to avoid those that are too serious and demanding. It is also important for you to find a job that provides thought-provoking tasks rather than routine and redundant responsibilities. You do best dealing with people, but the important thing  is that you have the freedom to express yourself at all times. You have an innate ability to think through complex matters and analyze them quickly, but then be off to something new.

Negative
You can become very irresponsible in tasks and decisions concerning your home and business life. The total pursuit of sensation and adventure can result in your becoming self-indulgent and totally unaware of the feelings of those around you. In the worse case situations you are very undependable and self-serving.
