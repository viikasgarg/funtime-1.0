The general influence of the number 7 pinnacle is that of learning, investigating, and gaining skills. The number 7 is a somewhat introverted number and you will tend to be more of a loner while the pinnacle is in effect. You will be more comfortable working alone, and while marriage is not out of the question during this time, it will take a good bit of effort. You are apt to need periods of isolation to develop inner resources. This time will be especially marked by your lack of interest in material matters and little concern with practical affairs. This lack of concern can result in some financial shortages, limited material benefits, or possibly physical handicaps.
