The Essence of the number 3 is a very special time when you feel and experience the joy of living to its utmost. This is a very enjoyable time in your life. You are apt to be making a lot of new friends and renewing old friendships. This is a time for love affairs and expanding the social circle; many activities and good times. You are likely to travel a good bit during this Essence.

The other factor that is associated with the Essence of 3 is that of expression. This is a very good time for you to be interested in the development of creative work, particularly works that involve words, singing, acting, or writing. This should be a busy time advancing your talents with classes or study, or for starting or expanding business ventures involving creative endeavors.

Optimism is the operative word for this cycle. This is a very pleasant period, but you must beware of a tendency now to scatter your energies.
