The 6 Essence focuses circumstances and opportunities on the home, the family, and largely on domestic matters. This time is associated with responsibility, but usually the job is close to home or involving those nearest to you, including your close friends. If you are single, this Essence is a very good time for marriage; if married, this is a good time for your marriage. It is a good time to surface any problems that may exist in the marriage and deal with them before they become more serious. This is also a time for children, and it may be a time to have a child. The 6 essence also may and often does involve you in service to your  community in some way; assuming responsibility for those outside your immediate family. This is more common if you are older and the need for your services in the immediate family is not apparent.
