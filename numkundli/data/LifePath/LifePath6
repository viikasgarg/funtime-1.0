Positive
You have a strong sense of responsibility. You are idealistic and must feel useful to be happy. The main contribution you make is that of advice, service and ever present support. You lead by example and assume responsibility, thus, it is your obligation to pick up the burden and always be ready to help. You are compelled to function with strength and compassion. You're a sympathetic and kind person, generous with personal and material resources. Wisdom, balance, and understanding are the cornerstones of your being. Your extraordinary wisdom and ability to understand other's problems is apt to commence from an early age. This ability allows you to easily span the generation gap and assume an important role in life, early on. While you may assume huge responsibilities in the community, your life revolves around your immediate home and family.

You're willingly carry far more than your fair share of the load and are always there when needed. You are very human and realistic about life, and you feel that the most important thing in your life is the home, family and friends.

Negative
You have a tendency to become overwhelmed by responsibilities and a slave to others. Also, avoid being too critical (of yourself or of others). You can occasionally exaggerate, and be self-righteous, imposing your views in an interfering or meddling way. On rare occasions, responsibility is abdicated, but this rejection of responsibility will make you feel very guilty and uneasy. It will have very damaging effects upon your relationships with others.
