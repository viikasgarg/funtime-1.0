Practical endeavors, status oriented, power-seeking, high-material goals.

Positive
You're focused on learning the satisfactions to be found in the material world. You can be powerful, confident and materially successful. You are apt to be very independent, forceful and competitive. Your routine is involved in practical, down-to-earth affairs, and there is relatively little time for dreams and visions. You will want to use your ambitions, your organizational ability, and your efficient approach to carve a satisfying niche for yourself. Most of your concerns involve money and learning of the power that comes with its proper manipulation.

You are concerned with status, as an accompaniment to material success. If you are a positive person, you are endowed with tremendous potential for conceiving far-reaching schemes and ideas. You also have the tenacity and independence to follow through with your ideas. In short, you are well-equipped for competition in the business world or in other  competitive fields of endeavor.

You know how to manage yourself and your environment. You are practical and steady in your pursuit of major objectives, and you have the courage of your convictions when it comes to taking the necessary chances to get ahead.

Negative
You can be dictatorial and often suppress the enthusiasm and efforts of fellow members of the environment. Often, the strength of your own personality excludes close feelings for other people with whom you come in contact. Material gains and rewards often become issues of utmost importance, even to the neglect of family, home and peace of mind. Dedication to success can become an obsession. Emotional feelings are often suppressed, resulting in isolation and loneliness. You must avoid discounting the opinions of others.
