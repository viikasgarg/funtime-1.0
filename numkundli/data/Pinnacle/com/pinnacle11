The number 11 is the first of the master numbers. The influence of this number is somewhat philosophic and illuminating. The 11 vibration has associations with spiritual and metaphysical studies and understanding. It has associations with the reformer, the philosopher, the welfare worker. With the number 11 energies influencing behavior in any stage of the life, there is a significant lessening of material goals and desires. In fact, thoughts may tend to stray a bit from the practical and the mundane, irrespective of the life path you may be following. A certain disassociation with mundane reality can cause problems with associates in the environment. Frequently, there is a heightened sense of nervous tension associated with this energy.
