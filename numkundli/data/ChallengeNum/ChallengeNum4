The challenge of the number 4 suggests a difficulty with work. Either you simply don't like to work, don't like the work you are forced to do, or you have difficulty completing tasks and working efficiently. You may be careless and lack a sense of practicality. Often this challenge makes it hard to see the forest for the trees when it comes to work and obligations. It is important for you to learn patience, understanding and the practical, common sense way of dealing with mundane responsibilities. You may  also need to learn the importance of working within the parameters of a time schedule.
