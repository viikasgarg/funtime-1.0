The main numbers in a numerology chart are called the Life Path, the Expression and the Soul Urge. The Life Path is the major lesson to be learned, the central focus in a person's life. The Expression represents a person's potential natural abilities, and the Soul Urge represents the person's inner nature, what he/she wants to do or be. The Life Path is the most important of these and represents about 40% of the whole. The Expression accounts for 30% and the Soul urge 20%. The remaining 10% is made up of other factors, particularly the day of birth.
