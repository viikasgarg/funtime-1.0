Love, Family, Home and Responsibility

This year tends to bring on increasing responsibilities and a deepening concern for family, loved ones, and close friends. It may be a year when you are called on to make some adjustments in your life, or sacrifices for those in your family or close circle of friends.

This is not really a year for major accomplishments, but rather a time to handle those adjustments to your plans that may be necessary or  required, and for finishing projects started earlier. Endeavors will seem to be moving very slowly throughout this year. You should expect to have a very good year so far as family, domestic, and romantic matters are concerned. Your emotional interchange with those who are close to you should be at its very best during this particular year. The important thing is to be willing to accept a slower pace and be sure to enjoy the peace and harmony that the personal year number 6 will bring.
